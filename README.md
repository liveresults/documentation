## Information for Organizers<a name="organizer"></a>
The system currently supports uploading results from the Swedish OLA system, SSFTiming, MEOS, OLEinzel (and OLStaffel) and other system that support output of IOF-XML continously.

If you would like to upload from an event system not listed above, please contact peter@lofas.se with information about the system and example export files.

### Events with many expected online viewers or customized layout
If you host a big international event and expect a large number of online visitors or want to have a customized logotype on the liveresults-page there is a possibility to rent cloud-based servers to a low cost (about 10EUR for one week) that will handle the traffic and show your logo. Please contact peter @ lofas .se if your are interested in this.

## For Developers<a name="developer"></a>
The system exposes a public free api that can be used for 3:rd party developers that want to create applications using data from the liveresults (for example Apps for Mobile Phones).
